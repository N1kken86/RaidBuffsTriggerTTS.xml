# RaidBuffsTriggerTTS.xml
A Triggernometry plug-in that broadcasts raid buffs, tank invuln to user when they pop in FFXIV.

Supports English/Japanese/Chinese client language

Japanese callout is selected by default, if you would like to use callout in other languages, please go into each trigger to select (and only one action to be selected)

Note:
For Buffs on self, it will only call out when the user actually gains the buff on themselves.

For Debuffs on boss and tank invuln, it will call out whenever a party member uses the associated action, whether it successfully lands or not(eg. Trick Attack)

For SCH aldo trigger, it will call out when a SCH in your party lands a Catalyze onto anyone else
